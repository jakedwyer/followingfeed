Example of using Airtop with Selenium:

```python
import { Builder, until } from 'selenium-webdriver';
import * as https from 'https';
import chrome from 'selenium-webdriver/chrome';
import { AirtopClient } from "@airtop/sdk";

const client = new AirtopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
const session = await client.sessions.create();

// Generate a custom HTTP agent to handle the authorization header
const customHttpAgent = new https.Agent({});
(customHttpAgent as any).addRequest = (req: any, options: any) => {
  req.setHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY');
  (https.Agent.prototype as any).addRequest.call(customHttpAgent, req, options);
};

// Create a new Chrome driver instance
const driver = await new Builder()
  .forBrowser('chrome')
  .usingHttpAgent(customHttpAgent)
  .usingServer(session.data.chromedriverUrl)
  .build();

// Open a new tab and navigate to the target URL
await driver.switchTo().newWindow('tab');
await driver.get("https://www.airtop.ai");
await driver.wait(until.titleContains('Airtop'), 10000);

// Get the page content
const content = await driver.getPageSource();
console.log(content);

```


###How to create a session with Airtop
What is a session?
A session represents an instance of a browser. Each session is identified by a unique UUID and can contain multiple windows that each can load a page.

How to create a session
You can create a session by simply calling the create function on the API as follows:


NodeJS

Python

client = Airtop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
session = client.sessions.create()
When you create a session, it may take a small amount of time to initialize. Usually it’s a matter of seconds, but in rare cases when hardware isn’t immediately available, it may take around 1 minute. The create function will wait until the session is fully initialized and ready to be used. However, if you would like to create a session and not wait for initialization, you can pass the skipWaitSessionReady parameter as true.


NodeJS

Python

# Also import SessionConfig to pass the configuration parameter
from airtop import Airtop, SessionConfig
client = Airtop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
session = client.sessions.create(configuration=SessionConfig(skip_wait_session_ready=True))
If you choose to not wait for the session to initialize, you can use the waitForSessionReady function to wait until the session is ready.


NodeJS

Python

client = Airtop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
session = await client.sessions.create(configuration=SessionConfig(skip_wait_session_ready=True))
# Session will be returned immediately but may not be ready for use
client.sessions.wait_for_session_ready(session.data.id)
# Session is now ready for use
By default, session have a TTL (Time To Live) of 10 mins. Once the TTL expires, the session will be automatically terminated. You can also specify a custom timeout when creating a session by passing the timeoutMinutes parameter.


NodeJS

Python

# Also import SessionConfigV1 to pass the configuration parameter
from airtop import Airtop, SessionConfig
client = Airtop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
session = client.sessions.create(configuration=SessionConfig(timeout_minutes=15))
You can also terminate a session at any point by calling the terminate function.


NodeJS

Python

client = Airtop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
session = client.sessions.create()
client.sessions.terminate(session.data.id)
Remember that sessions are billed per 30s increments, so it’s important to terminate sessions when you’re done with them to avoid unnecessary charges.

Session States
Sessions can be in one of the following states:

initializing: The session is pending initialization.
awaiting_capacity: The session is waiting for capacity.
running: The session is running and ready for use.
ended: The session has been ended by the user or due to inactivity.
In general, if you are creating a session via the SDK without the skipWaitSessionReady: true parameter, you do not need to worry about initializing and awaiting_capacity states. These states are only relevant if you are creating a session with the skipWaitSessionReady: true parameter or directly through the REST API. A session might be ended if it terminated due to TTL timeout, if you explicitly terminate it, or if it was terminated due to an error.

You can check the state of a session by calling the getInfo function.


NodeJS

Python

client = Airtop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
session = client.sessions.getinfo(session.data.id)
print(session.data.status)
Profiles
When creating a session, you can choose to save the profile of the browser for future use, or load a saved profile. This will allow you to reuse cookies and local storage between sessions. For more detailed information on how to use profiles, see Profiles.

Windows
After you create a session, you can create one or more windows to load pages within the session. You can create a window by calling the create function on the windows API.


NodeJS

Python

window = client.windows.create(session.data.id, url="https://www.airtop.ai")
Wait Until Options
Before you can interact or prompt the page, the page must be fully loaded. You can provide a waitUntil parameter to the create function to customize exactly what you are waiting for. There are 2 options for the waitUntil parameter: load and domcontentloaded.

load: Wait until the page and all resources are fully loaded (default).
domcontentloaded: Wait until the DOM is fully loaded.

NodeJS

Python

window = client.windows.create(session.data.id, url="https://www.airtop.ai", wait_until="domcontentloaded")
Screen Resolution
You can also specify the screen resolution of the window by passing the screenResolution parameter to the create function. This is useful if you want to ensure that the browser is loaded at a specific resolution. The screen resolution should be passed as a string in the format of widthxheight.


NodeJS

Python

window = client.windows.create(session.data.id, url="https://www.airtop.ai", screen_resolution="1920x1080")
Loading URLs
If you’ve already created a window and want to load a URL in it, you can use the loadUrl function using the window ID.


NodeJS

Python

# Create a window and load URL 1
window = client.windows.create(session.data.id, url="https://www.airtop.ai")
# Load URL 2
client.windows.load_url(session.data.id, window.data.window_id, url="https://www.google.com")
Closing Windows
If you terminate a browser session (see Timeouts and Termination above), all windows associated with that session will be closed automatically.

If you have a window ID, you can close that specific window by calling the close function.


NodeJS

Python

client.windows.close(session_id, window_id)
This can be useful if you have a long running session with multiple windows and want to close windows you aren’t using anymore to free up resources.



### How to save and restore profiles with Airtop

What are profiles?
Profiles are saved archives of the artifacts produced by a browsing session. Most importantly, they contain the cookies and local storage of a session, which can be used to hydrate future sessions and keep the same authenticated state. You will want to use profiles when your users need to authenticate to a site via a Live View, and you want to save the authenticated state for your agents to use.

Creating a new profile
When you create a new session, you can request that the profile generated by that session be persisted by passing the persistProfile parameter as true.


NodeJS

Python

session = client.sessions.create(configuration=SessionConfig(persist_profile=True))
profile_id = session.data.profileId
When the session returns, you will have a new profile ID that you can use to restore the profile later. Note that the profile will not be persisted until the session has been terminated.

Restoring an existing profile
If you have an existing profile ID, you can restore the profile by passing it to the sessions.create method.


NodeJS

Python

session = client.sessions.create(configuration=SessionConfig(base_profile_id="YOUR_PROFILE_ID"))
This session will be restored from the existing profile.

Profiles are immutable and cannot be changed once created. When you restore a profile, you are duplicating a base profile and making modifications to it. If you want to save a modified version of a profile, you will need start with a base profile and also request that your session’s profile be persisted, thereby creating a new profile.


NodeJS

Python

session = client.sessions.create(configuration=SessionConfig(persist_profile=True, base_profile_id="ORIGINAL_PROFILE_ID"))
profile_id = session.data.profile_Id
In this example, ORIGINAL_PROFILE_ID will be used to restore the profile, but the modified version of the profile will be saved with a new ID returned in profileId.

Fetching and deleting profiles
You can fetch a list of all profiles for your account using the profiles.get method.


NodeJS

Python

profiles = client.profiles.get()
You can also fetch a single profile by ID or a list of IDs, which is useful if you want to check the status of a profile.


NodeJS

Python

profile = client.profiles.get(profile_ids=["PROFILE_ID"])
profiles = client.profiles.get(profile_ids=["PROFILE_ID", "ANOTHER_PROFILE_ID"])
Finally, you can delete profiles by ID, if you no longer want to retain them.


NodeJS

Python

client.profiles.delete(profile_ids="PROFILE_ID")
client.profiles.delete(profile_ids=["PROFILE_ID", "ANOTHER_PROFILE_ID"])

### How to use Airtop with Selenium
Integrating with Selenium

How to use Selenium with Airtop

Selenium is a powerful automation framework for web browsers. Airtop provides a Selenium connector that allows you to use Selenium to automate your browser.

Installation
You will need to install the selenium-webdriver package to use Selenium with Airtop.


NodeJS (npm)

NodeJS (yarn)

NodeJS (pnpm)

Python

pip install selenium
Usage
Once you have created a session with Airtop, you can use the Selenium library to control the browser by connecting Selenium to the ChromeDriver endpoint provided by Airtop.


NodeJS

Python

from airtop import Airtop
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.remote_connection import ChromeRemoteConnection
def create_airtop_selenium_connection(airtop_api_key, airtop_session_data, *args, **kwargs):
    class AirtopRemoteConnection(ChromeRemoteConnection):
        @classmethod
        def get_remote_connection_headers(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            headers = super().get_remote_connection_headers(*args, **kwargs)
            headers['Authorization'] = f'Bearer {airtop_api_key}'
            return headers
    return AirtopRemoteConnection(remote_server_addr=airtop_session_data.chromedriver_url, *args, **kwargs)
# Initialize Airtop client
client = Airtop(api_key=api_key)
session = client.sessions.create()
# Connect to the Airtop cloud browser with Selenium and navigate to a page.
try:
  browser = webdriver.Remote(
    command_executor=create_airtop_selenium_connection(api_key, session.data),
    options=webdriver.ChromeOptions(),
  )
  browser.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket")
  # Get the window info and scrape the page content
  window_info = client.windows.get_window_info_for_selenium_driver(
    session.data,
    browser,
  )
  print(f"Live view url: {window_info.data.live_view_url}")
  scrape = client.windows.scrape_content(session_id=session.data.id, window_id=window_info.data.window_id, time_threshold_seconds=60)
  print(scrape.data.model_response.scraped_content)
  browser.quit()
finally:
  # Terminate the Airtop session.
  client.sessions.terminate(session.data.id)
If you’re not already familiar with Selenium, you might want to check out their documentation to learn more about the library and its capabilities.

Required
ID of the session that owns the window.

Request
This endpoint expects an object.
screenResolution
string
Optional
Defaults to 1280x720
Affects the live view configuration. By default, a live view will fill the parent frame (or local window if loaded directly) when initially loaded, causing the browser window to be resized to match. This parameter can be used to instead configure the returned liveViewUrl so that the live view is loaded with fixed dimensions (e.g. 1280x720), resizing the browser window to match, and then disallows any further resizing from the live view.

Optional
Defaults to https://www.google.com
Initial url to navigate to

waitUntil
enum
Optional
Defaults to load
Allowed values:
load
domContentLoaded
complete
Wait until the specified loading event occurs. Defaults to ‘load’, which waits until the page dom and it’s assets have loaded. ‘domContentLoaded’ will wait until the dom has loaded, and ‘complete’ will wait until the page and all it’s iframes have loaded it’s dom and assets.

Airtop API
Windows
Get information about a browser window in a session
GET
https://api.airtop.ai/api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/windows/:windowId
Path parameters
sessionId
string
Required
ID of the session that owns the window.

windowId
string
Required
ID of the browser window, which can either be a normal AirTop windowId or a CDP TargetId from a browser automation library like Puppeteer (typically associated with the page or main frame). Our SDKs will handle retrieving a TargetId for you from various popular browser automation libraries, but we also have details in our guides on how to do it manually.

Query parameters
includeNavigationBar
boolean
Optional
Affects the live view configuration. A navigation bar is not shown in the live view of a browser by default. Set this to true to configure the returned liveViewUrl so that a navigation bar is rendered, allowing users to easily navigate the browser to other pages from the live view.

disableResize
boolean
Optional
Affects the live view configuration. Set to true to configure the returned liveViewUrl so that the ability to resize the browser window from the live view is disabled (resizing is allowed by default). Note that, at initial load, the live view will automatically fill the parent frame (or local window if loaded directly) and cause the browser window to be resized to match. This parameter does not affect that initial load behavior. See screenResolution for a way to set a fixed size for the live view.

screenResolution
string
Optional
Affects the live view configuration. By default, a live view will fill the parent frame (or local window if loaded directly) when initially loaded, causing the browser window to be resized to match. This parameter can be used to instead configure the returned liveViewUrl so that the live view is loaded with fixed dimensions (e.g. 1280x720), resizing the browser window to match, and then disallows any further resizing from the live view.
