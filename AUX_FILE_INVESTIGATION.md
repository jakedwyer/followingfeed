# Investigation Report: 'aux' File in Git History

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: ⚠️ **FILE WAS COMMITTED BUT NOW REMOVED**

---

## Executive Summary

The `aux` file **WAS committed** to the git repository but has since been:
- ✅ **DELETED** from the repository (Feb 11, 2025)
- ✅ **ADDED to .gitignore** to prevent future commits
- ✅ **NOT currently tracked** by git

However, it **still exists in git history**, which could be a concern if it contains sensitive data.

## Current Status

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| File exists in repo | ✅ NO | File has been deleted |
| File tracked by git | ✅ NO | Not currently tracked |
| File in .gitignore | ✅ YES | Protected at line 52 |
| File in git history | ⚠️ YES | Exists in historical commits |

---

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Good News
1. File is **NOT** in current repository
2. File is **NOT** currently tracked by git
3. File is **NOW protected** by .gitignore
4. File **will NOT be pushed** in future commits

### ⚠️ Concern
1. File **exists in git history** (commits from July 2024)
2. Anyone with access to the repository can view historical versions
3. If the file contained sensitive data, it may still be accessible

---

## What is 'aux'?

The `aux` file appears to be a temporary or auxiliary file. Common uses:
- Temporary processing file
- Build artifact
- LaTeX auxiliary file
- System-generated temporary file

**Note**: Unable to retrieve file contents from git history in current check.

---

## Recommendations

### If 'aux' Contains Sensitive Data: ⚠️

**You should remove it from git history:**

```bash
# Method 1: Using git filter-branch (older method)
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch aux" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Method 2: Using BFG Repo-Cleaner (recommended)
bfg --delete-files aux

# After either method, force push (if already pushed to remote)
git push origin --force --all
```

### If 'aux' is Just a Temporary File: ✅

**Current protection is sufficient:**
- ✅ File is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ File is deleted from repository
- ✅ File won't be committed again

---

## Verification Commands

To verify the file is properly protected:

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la aux  # Should return "No such file"

# Check if tracked
git ls-files | grep aux  # Should return nothing

# Check if in gitignore
grep "aux" .gitignore  # Should show "aux"

# Check git history
git log --all --oneline -- aux  # Shows historical commits
```

---

## For Public GitHub Release

### Current Status: ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Before pushing to public GitHub:**

1. ✅ File is gitignored (won't be in future commits)
2. ✅ File is not in current repository
3. ⚠️ File IS in git history

**Action Required:**
- Review what the `aux` file contained
- If it had sensitive data, purge from git history
- If it was just temporary data, current protection is sufficient

---

## Git History Impact

If this repository is pushed to GitHub, anyone can access:
- Current files ✅ (aux not present)
- Historical commits ⚠️ (aux visible in July 2024 - Feb 2025)

---

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ **CURRENTLY PROTECTED** but ⚠️ **EXISTS IN HISTORY**

The `aux` file is properly protected for future commits but exists in git history. If you plan to make this a public repository and the `aux` file contained any sensitive information, you should remove it from git history before publishing.

**Next Steps**:
1. Determine what the `aux` file contained
2. If sensitive: Remove from git history
3. If not sensitive: Current protection is sufficient
